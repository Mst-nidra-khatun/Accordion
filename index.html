                This is the first item's accordion body. It is shown by default, until the collapse plugin adds
                the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall
                appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this
                with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any
                HTML can go within the . accordion-body, though the transition does limit overflow.  </div>
